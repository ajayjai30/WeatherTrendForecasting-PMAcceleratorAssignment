# Global Weather Forecasting Project Report
1. Introduction
Project Overview:
This project involves forecasting global weather conditions using various analytical and machine learning techniques. The analysis spans from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to advanced forecasting using multiple models and anomaly detection.

Company Mission:
“By making industry-leading tools and education available to individuals from all backgrounds, we level the playing field for future PM leaders. This is the PM Accelerator motto, as we grant aspiring and experienced PMs what they need most – Access. We introduce you to industry leaders, surround you with the right PM ecosystem, and discover the new world of AI product management skills.”

Purpose of the Report:
The report covers both basic and advanced assessments including data cleaning & preprocessing, EDA, model building for time series forecasting, and unique analyses (such as climate, environmental impact, feature importance, and spatial analysis). The goal is to showcase a comprehensive approach to handling, analyzing, and forecasting global weather data.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2.1 Data Acquisition and Initial Inspection
Data Source: GlobalWeatherRepository.csv

Initial Steps:

Imported libraries and installed dependencies.

Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure with .info() and .describe().

Converted date columns (e.g., last_updated) into datetime format.

2.2 Handling Missing Values and Outliers
Missing Values:

Counted null values in each column and identified specific dates with missing data.

Applied manual corrections for identified missing dates (e.g., copying previous day’s values).

Outlier Considerations:

Outlier handling was discussed but in this dataset every value was considered important, so no data points were removed.

2.3 Feature Engineering and Data Transformation
Column Selection:

Kept essential columns and removed duplicate/redundant features (e.g., converting Fahrenheit to Celsius).

Encoding:

Applied label encoding for categorical features (e.g., condition_text and wind_direction).

Normalization:

Applied scaling techniques where necessary for model readiness.
